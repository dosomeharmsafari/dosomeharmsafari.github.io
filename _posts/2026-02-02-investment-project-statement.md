This project is my battle for the freedom I want in life. It's about building a safety net for my survival, granting me the right to say no to anything not authentic to me. This ensures me the headspace to wander, focus only on what truly makes me feel alive and push beyond limits.

Unlike other skills, investing lacks a trustworthy learning path and there is no clear benchmark to separate investing from gambling. But the biggest enemy is always internal. My mind has been wired with a poisoned relationship with money and an operating system prone to scattered focus and being easily crushed in the early deep-thinking process.

Therefore, this project is my weapon to directly attack my own flaw to force clarity, judged by a simple, uncompromising rule: if I can't explain it clearly, I haven't truly understood it myself. It is also my attempt to anticipate threats, inspired by Charlie Munger's wisdom: 'All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there.'

The mission goal is to build a reliable framework, guarded by two core principles: investing is not gambling, and never lose money. The framework is the key to unlock the crucial mental shift: from seeing money as a survival defence to be anxiously hoarded, to leveraging it as a productive asset deployed for freedom.
