This writing project was sparked by my own struggle when I jumped into aviation with absolutely zero background. I literally didn't know enough to even ask a question as the basic framework is missing. The Instructors conventionally assume everyone already knew some things, making those foundational questions feel completely out of reach. 

Here, I will explain the basics in my own words and try to connect the separated concepts. Expect honest talks about how things actually work, stories from my own struggles during the training and my insights along the way.

For me, learning to fly wasn't just about a plane; it was about taking responsibility for my own life, risking myself, and finding immense enjoyment. This project aims to bridge that unnoticed gap—dedicated to the one who needs the full logical picture while also serves as my way of keeping the big dream alive, until I can fly again.
